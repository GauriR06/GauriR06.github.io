Simple website I created.
* Link to the site: https://gaurir06.github.io/

## Description
This is a simple website to create and access blog posts and webpages.

### Webpages

* Home: https://gaurir06.github.io/
* Blog: https://gaurir06.github.io/blog/
* About: https://gaurir06.github.io/about/

### Jekyll
* It is a static website generator. 
* The _config.yml file, created in the repository, informs Jekyll basic information about our website.
* I used liquid tags such as {{page.title}} and {{content}}. These are used to fill in the content present in the files created into the Main Webpage.
